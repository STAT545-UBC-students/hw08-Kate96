# HW08 repository

This is the repository for the ***8th homework assignment*** for UBC STAT545/547M course (2018W).
- Completed by *Kate Tyshchenko (Kate96)*

#### This repo contains:
1. [R code to make the app](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-Kate96/blob/master/bcl/app.R)
2. [Raw data table](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-Kate96/blob/master/bcl/bcl-data.csv)
3. [The logo for BC liquor store](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-Kate96/blob/master/bcl/www/bcliquorstore.jpg) - taken from [here](http://hillsidecentre.com/store-directory/directory/listing/b-c-liquor-store)

##### Tasks that I did:
- Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI.
- Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table.
- The app currently behaves strangely when the user selects filters that return 0 results. Try to figure out why this warning message is appearing, and how to fix it.
- Add a widget - filter by alcohol content.
- Add a widget - filter by subtype (with removing the subtypes not applicable to the chosen type in advance).

This repo contained the BC Liquor app as a boilerplate for students to add to in Homework 08.

The code and data are from [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial). The code can specifically be found [here](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#12-final-shiny-app-code).
