# HW08 repository

This is the repository for the ***8th homework assignment*** for UBC STAT545/547M course (2018W).
- Completed by *Kate Tyshchenko (Kate96)*

Tasks that I did:
- Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI.
- Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table.
- The app currently behaves strangely when the user selects filters that return 0 results. Try to figure out why this warning message is appearing, and how to fix it.
- Allow the user to search for multiple alcohol types simultaneously, instead of being able to choose only wines/beers/etc.
- Add a widget - filter by alcohol content
- Add a widget - filter by subtype

This repo contained the BC Liquor app as a boilerplate for students to add to in Homework 08.
